How to Use

<&usage1>You're going to need the hammer and a material of your choice.
See <link;immersiveposts:posts;this;start> for a detailed list of things able to be used.<np>
<&usage2>Then with your choosen material in hand rightclick the base with it and it should look like what's being shown in the image above.
Note: It always has to be of the same type! A wooden post for example only accepts §oTreated Wood Fences§r nothing else!<np>
<&usage3>From here you can also rightclick the post itself which makes it easier to see how high you've already made it.

Isnt that neat?<np>
<&usage4>Now, to get the 1-Wide arm you simply rightclick with your hammer in hand at the desired side and height. To remove it rightclick the side of the post the arm is on. (Or break it with an axe)
§nNote: It won't apear if there is a block in the way.§r<np>
<&usage5>Rightclicking the arm itself will turn it into a 2-Wide arm and vise-versa.

Like with the 1-Wide, if there isnt enough space it will not change.<np>
<&usage6>The one 1-Wide Arm flips up-side-down if it detects any block below it, §oeven§r if there is already one above it.

For §ostability§r reasons, the 2-Wide Arm however can §lnot§r flip up-side-down.<np>
<&usage7>§nPost Arm§r
Placing non-solid blocks on the sides (Like connectors/relays) makes these cute little arms apear, making sure whatever you attached doesnt look like it's floating in the air.<np>
<&usage8>§nHorizontal Truss§r
Line up two posts with at least 1 block (up to <config;i;maxTrussLength>) of empty space in between.
Sneak + Right-click with the hammer on inner side of any of them. Do the same if you want to remove an already existing truss.
